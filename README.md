# connect-it
iot api for deployment on rasp

# Executive summary
It is planned to collect resources and develop an app in order to do the following things:
* set up a redirection by upnp from a rasp (compute module + wifi ?)
* connect and update a dyndns service OR prepare an own equivalent, using a unique device id.
* host a micro website on the device, allowing for a direct on site connection,
* write a rest API for communication from internet (using whatever -> mobile app, central website ...)
* control a webcam
* control simple GPIO devices
* automatised update deployment
